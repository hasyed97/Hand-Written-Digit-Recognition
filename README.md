# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
## Problem Statement
This project is based on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) available as the part of TensorFlow / Keras datasets. We had to extend the MNIST standard implementation to recognize hand written digits to develop the following features.
* To gather our own data of hand-written digits (at least 200 unique samples).
* to test the MNIST implementation on your data.
* To make our program able to convert an image containing an integer of up to 5 digits into equivalent number. For example, 45321, 88881, 23019 etc

## Results
We ran the tests for each model a hundred times on the same 204 images in our dataset. The accuracy achieved with CNN was 96.56% and the time it took to execute was 78.78 seconds. While on the other hand, SVM did not achieve a decent level of accuracy standing at 54.47% in a time of 2.41 seconds.
